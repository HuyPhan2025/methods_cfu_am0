# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:

# The include? method is called on the string object "Hello World" to check what is place in the parameter 
# No argument are passed; include? method has one clear job which is to search the string to see if the word in parameter is include in the string
# The return value is "true"
"Hello World".include?("Hello")

# The end_with method is called on the string object "Hello World" to check what is place in the parameter 
# No argument are passed; end_with? method has one clear job which is to search the string to check if what is place in the parameter is at the end of the string
# The return value is "false"
"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")

# The end_with method is called on the string object "Hello World" to check what is place in the parameter 
# No argument are passed; end_with? method has one clear job which is to search the string to check if what is place in the parameter is at the end of the string
# The return value is "true"
"Hello World".end_with?("rld")

# The even? method is called on the integer 12
# No argument are passed; even? method has one clear job which is to check if the integer is even
# The return value is "true"
12.even?

# The next method is called on the integer 18
# No argument are passed; next method has one clear job which is to return integer which is one higher than the integer it was called upon
# The return value is "19"
18.next
