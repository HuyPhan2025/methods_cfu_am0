# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods? I feel like I'm still lacking and need to refer back to my note a lot.  It was harder than I imagine.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own? For simple methods I feel like I can write them pretty well, but I need to be more flexible in my thinking so I can be even better at it.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!) I would like to learn how to include more information into my method.  I am capable of writing very simple method with single variable but struggle when I tried to get more values to run if that make since.  How do you get a method to run "Your name is Erik, you are 30, and from Colorado?
